(if any problem happens with the video, there's also a youtube alternative: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED1iLibSrzA )

I took the liberty to add a few things while creating the solution, like a MainPage layout and the Button as a Input but I tried to not deviate from the main objective.

Some improvements/changes that I would like to do
- Using namespaces and autoloading (With composer)
- A few Unit and Feature tests with PHPUnit to check the validations and object creations
